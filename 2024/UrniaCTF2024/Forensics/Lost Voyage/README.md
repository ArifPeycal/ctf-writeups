## Challenge Description
We were give `Alice.pcapng` to analyze. We found several common protocols inside the `pcap` file such as `TCP`, `ICMP` and `DNS`. But, there is one protocol that is quite interesting due to percentage of bytes which is `Real-Time Transport Protocol`.

> RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) is a network protocol used for delivering audio and video over IP networks in real time. It is widely used in streaming media, telephony (VoIP), video conferencing, and other real-time multimedia applications.

Filter the `RTP` packets and we can see the audio being transported.

## Solution

So, we need to find a way to listen to the audio. I found out <a href="https://support.yeastar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007606533-How-to-Analyze-SIP-Calls-in-Wireshark"> this page </a> where it shows how to listen to the `RTP` stream.

### How to Play RTP Stream: 
- Use 'rtp' as the expression to filter RTP packets.
- Use the menu 'Telephony > RTP > RTP Streams'.
-  Select and Play Stream in the call list

Listen to the audio and we get the flag.
