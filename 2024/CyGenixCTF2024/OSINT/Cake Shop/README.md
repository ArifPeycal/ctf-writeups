# Cake Shop
## Description
> I visited the Church in Goa when I was at my vacation a long time back during Christmas eve. So, one of my local friend bought me a cake as a gift and it was so amazing and delicious. He told me that he bought it from a nearby cake shop. Could you please help me locate it and provide me the cake shop reviews. Thanks!


## Solution
- We get a picture of a church, by using Google Lens we get the location which is ```Archaeological Museum of Goa, India```
- Seacrh "cake shop" near the location of the church and there is one shop called ```Monginis Cake Shop```.
- Sort reviews from the latest, flag is on the first review. <br>
