# 🅰️ 🦵 🌱
## Description
> There's a bug bounty program on Intigriti I wanted to revisit. The problem is I only speak emojis these days and completely forgot the name of the program! Can you remind me?
> 
> Emojis: 🅰️ 🦵 🌱

> Note: Flag format is CSCTF{name_of_program}

## Solution
From the emoji, we can conclude that the program must start with "`A`". The 🦵  and 🌱 emoji can be interpreted as many words so for now we can just search for any bounty program that starts with "A" and related with the remaining emoji. After scrolling, there is one program that meet the requirements.
