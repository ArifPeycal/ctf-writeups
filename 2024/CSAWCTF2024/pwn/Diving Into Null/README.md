## Challenge Description
When we connected to the server, we found out that some of the commands cannot be executed such as `ls`, `cat` and `dir`.

We can see the list of commands that we can use by typing `help`. These commands are also known as `shell built-in`. 

> A shell built-in is a command or function that is directly integrated into the shell itself, rather than being an external executable file. These commands are part of the shellâ€™s internal code, meaning they don't require a separate process to run.

So, we need to use only the commands above to search for the flag.
## Solution

Upon inspection, we found out that there is a user `groot` in `/home` directory. The flag most probably be in this directory. Now, we need to find a way to list files and directories in `/home/groot`. 

I found out that `compgen` can be used to list directories, files and commands. 
- `-c`: Generate command names.
- `-d`: Generate directory names.
- `-e`: Generate environment variable names.
- `-f`: Generate file names.

We found `.flag` file that may contain the flag. Now, we need to read the file. I tried to use `source` but it didnt give the flag. 

So, I refered to <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/bypass-bash-restrictions">this cheatsheet</a> by Hactricks to bypass Linux bash restrictions. We can use this command to read every line in a file. I tried it with `/etc/passwd` and it gives the expected result. Now, we can read `.flag` file. 

```
# Read file with read
while read -r line; do echo $line; done < /etc/passwd
```
