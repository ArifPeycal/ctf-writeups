## Challenge Overview

This challenge is the continuation of `Literally 1984`. The challenge description stated that the composer, `Susumu Hirasawa` made a song as a band in 1992 where `&zwnj;` (x0o0x_ ) also sang a cover for it. This time, `&zwnj;` was collabing with another artist and we need to find that artist's name.  

## Solution
We already know that the composer's band is called `P-Model`, so we just need to search "x0o0x_ p-model" to see if the artist had covered one of the band's song. We found one song titled `LAB=01` where `x0o0x_ ` collaborated with another artist named `Chogakusei`.

## Remarks

This challenge is much easier compared to `Literally 1984`. So, once you solved that challenge, this one is basically free points for you.
